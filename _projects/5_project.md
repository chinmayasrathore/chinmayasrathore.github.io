### ☑️ About Dips

The Digital Image Processing Simulator (DIPS) is an interactive Digital Image Processing learning tool for Windows XP/7/8/10/11. DIPS covers a core body of digital image processing concepts which are usually taught in Remote Sensing courses and are critical to the understanding of image analaysis. DIPS tries to bridge a learning gap between classroom explanations of concepts and their demonstration on the image processing system. It has been designed in a way that it can be shared between the student and the teacher.It can be used by the teacher to conveniently explain difficult to understand image processing concepts during a lecture, while it can also be used by the student to follow up concepts explained in the class.

### 📋 Image Processing Topics Covered
DIPS is primarily aimed at introductory digital image processing courses in remote sensing. DIPS covers a core body of digital image processing concepts. DIPS has been specifically designed to expose detailed calculations of image processing algorithms using small sample images. The users (students and teachers) can change these small sample images to build their own examples and add to the pool of exercises. Concepts covered by DIPS include:

- Display of Colour on Multiband Digital Images
 - Gun Band Assignments
 - Additive and Subtractive Primary Colours
- Linear Contrast Stretching
- BSQ,BIL and BIP Digital Data formats
- Line dropout and Salt and Pepper noise removal
- Operation of Low Pass and high pass convolution filters
- Image Ratioing
- Normalized Vegetation Difference Index
- Image Differencing (subtraction)
- Linear Edge Enhancement
- Density Slicing
- Supervised Classification
 - Signature Definition
 - Minimum Distance to Mean Classifier
 - Parallelepiped Classifier
 - Comparison of Classification Outputs
- Accuracy Assessment
 - Random Selection of Pixels on Classified and Ground maps
 - Computation of Error Matrix and % Correct
 - Omission and Commission Errors
 - Computation of Kappa Statistic
