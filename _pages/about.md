Hi! I am Chinmaya. I have around four decades of teaching, research, consulting and academic administration experience in higher education. I have served as Professor and Dean at the Indian Institute of Forest Management, Bhopal, India in the faculty of Information Technology and Quantitative Techniques. I have also served as a faculty member at the Indian Institute of Technology, Dhanbad, India. 

I have been a Leverhulme postdoctoral fellow at the University of Aberdeen, Scotland UK and have consulted for FAO, DFID and other agencies. I love teaching and have been an educator for close to four decades.

I am a self-professed advocate of open source software and have keen interest in environmental conservation, stellite remote sensing, mapping, philosophy, poetry and music. I also love tinkering around with Linux distros.
